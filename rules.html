                            Solutions to problems submitted for judging are called runs. Each run is judged as
                            accepted or rejected by a judge, and the team is notified of the results.

                            Notification of accepted runs may be suspended at an appropriate time to keep the
                            final results secret. A general announcement to that effect will be made during the
                            contest. Notification of rejected runs will continue until the end of the contest.

                            A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem statement by
                            submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the judges agree that an ambiguity
                            or error exists, a clarification will be issued to all contestants.

                            Contestants are not to converse with anyone except members of their team and
                            personnel designated by the regional contest director. Systems support staff may
                            advise contestants on system-related problems such as explaining system error
                            messages.</br>

                            While the contest is scheduled for a particular time length (typically five hours),
                            the regional contest director has the authority to alter the length of the contest
                            in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Should the contest duration be altered,
                            every attempt will be made to notify contestants in a timely and uniform manner.

                            A team may be disqualified by the regional contest director for any activity that
                            jeopardizes the contest such as dislodging extension cords, unauthorized
                            modification of contest materials, or distracting behavior.

                            At least six problems will be posed. So far as possible, problems will avoid
                            dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular applications area or particular
                        contest language.</br>

                            <p>A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are solely responsible
                                for
                                accepting or rejecting submitted runs. In consultation with the judges, the Regional
                                Contest
                                Director determines the winners of the regional contest. The regional contest director
                                and
                                judges are empowered to adjust for or adjudicate unforeseen events and conditions. Their
                                decisions are final.</br>

                                Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. For the purposes of awards, or
                                in
                                determining qualifier(s) for the World Finals, teams who solve the same number of
                                problems
                                are ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each
                                problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the
                                beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes
                                for
                                every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time
                                consumed
                                for a problem that is not solved.</br>

                                It is the responsibility of the Regional Contest Director to specify any additional
                                tie-breakers. Tie-breaker policies must be announced to contestants before the contest
                                begins.</p>

                                programming languages may be used. The programming languages of the World Finals are
                                Java, Kotlin, Python and C/C++. Prior to the World Finals, the judges will have solved
                                all problems in Java and C/C++.

                                </br>Each team will use a single workstation. The regional contest director is responsible
                                for determining that teams have reasonably equivalent computing resources.
